# Countries take on debt not just for necessities but to support economic development. Infrastructure spending, for instance, is a costly yet crucial investment for a countryâ€™s progress. The World Bank provides debt financing to developing countries to facilitate such initiatives.

# This project will focus on orecasting international debt trends using World Bank data. The dataset includes information on the total debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across multiple debt categories from 1970 to 2015.
